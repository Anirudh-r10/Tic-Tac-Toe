# Tic-Tac-Toe
The provided code is a Python implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows for both single-player and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the player competes against the computer, while in multiplayer mode, two human players can play against each other. The game uses a basic implementation of the Minimax algorithm to determine the optimal moves for the computer player.

The code includes functions for displaying the current state of the board, taking user input for placing X or O marks, evaluating the board for a win or draw, implementing the Minimax algorithm for the computer player, and controlling the game flow. The main() function serves as the entry point of the program, allowing the user to select the game mode and starting player.

By running the code, users can play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer or against another player, experiencing an interactive and challenging game of strategy and decision-making.
